Security Token Service
Federation:
    Active Directory, Uses SAML Security Assertion Markup Language
	Allows access to one domain (AWS) based on membership roles in another domain (AD)
Identity Broker:
	Allows you to take identity with one service and federate it with another (Okta or AD Federation Services)
Identity Store:
	Services like AD, Facebook, Gmail
Scenario:
	1) User enters username and password
	2) Application calls Identity Broker (Okta) and it captures un + pw
	3) Identity broker validates un + pw with existing LDAP directory
	4) Identity broker calls GetFederationToken function using IAM credentials. The call for temp creds must reference existing IAM policy and 1-36 hr duration
	5) STS confirms IAM policy allowed by IAM user gives permission to create new tokens and returns 4 values:
		a) access key
		b) secret access key
		c) token
		d) duration (token life)
	6) Identity broker returns temp creds from STS to original application
	7) Data storage part of original app uses STS creds to make S3 requests
	8) S3 uses IAM to validate STS creds
	9) IAM authorizes s3 to perform requested action
	
Logging:
	Read white paper: "Security at Scale: Logging in AWS"
	Remember ISO 27001, PCI DSS, FedRamp, HIPAA, and other security standards with common logging reqs
	Control access with: MFA delete on object, S3 bucket policies, IAM policies to restrict users/groups/roles/policies
	AWS CloudTrail, Config, CloudWatch, VPC Flow logs are main AWS services
	CloudWatch monitors performance, CloudTrail monitors API calls, Config records env state and notifies of changes

Security Groups are config of the firewall of the hypervisor
Physical interface -> Firewall -> Customer1 Sec Group -> Virtual Inteface -> Hypervisor -> Customer 1 services like EC2 virtual instances
Virtual Instances are 100% customer responsibility and they have root access to it
Memory scrubbing automatically occurs setting all block storage to 0s before allowing another customer use
HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) over PV (ParaVirtualization) where possible. PV no longer quicker and isolated by layers Guest OS on layer 1, apps layer 3. HVM guests fully virtualized and not aware sharing processing time.
AWS admins have access to hypervisor host machines which run virtual guest machines

Tenancy field on 3. Configure Instance ec2 setup
Dedicated Instances run in VPC on hardware dedicated to a single customer (other non-dedicated instances by same customer may end up in same hardware)
Dedicated Hosts give you additional visibility on hardware each host is and satisfies licensing, regulatory, compliance reqs. Can see sockets, cores, host id, etc. targeted placement, affinity between host and instance

AWS Systems Manager EC2 Run Command - EC2 Role for Systems Manager in IAM
Run Command has some defaults, even for windows PITA to login and dont need 3389 rdp security group rule, and also shows AWS cli equiv at bottom of SSM UI
Can run commands on list of instances based on instance tags or selecting manually
SSM agent needs to be installed and role allowing on managed instances and can be on prem too

Parameter Store - Under EC2 left pane bottom Systems Manager Shared Resources
e.g. Adobe License Key using KMS encryption that can be applied elsewhere as single object, call in lambda CF etc. 
Confidential information store - pw, db connection strings, license codes, etc.
Systems Manager Parameter Store compatible with ec2, ec2 run command, lambda, CloudFormation (not RDS though)

S3 pre-signed URLs
IAM S3 admin access applied to ec2
"aws s3 mb s3://exampbucks" makes bucket
"aws s3 ls s3://exampbucks" list objects in bucket
"aws s3 presign s3://exampbucks/hello.txt --expires-in 300" pre-signed url for 300 seconds, even if bucket or acl private

Config rules for S3 - No public read access or write access 

Know difference between AWS Inspector vs AWS Trusted Advisor
AWS Inspector (IAM/Security) - automated security assessment to improve security and compliance and applications. Looks for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practice. Generates result report categorized by CVE, CIS OS benchmarks, sec best practices, or runtime behavior analysis; and prioritize by severity. 
Trusted Advisor offers some free checks/recommendations, but a lot of them require higher paid tiers. Cost optimization, performance, fault tolerance checks (security too but associate that with Inspector)
If security, Trusted Advisor = security groups open, MFA on root, etc. Inspector = "Assessment Target", agents installed on ec2, "Asessment Template", "Asessment Run", "Findings" for reports on security vulnerabilities

AWS manages security *of* the cloud, customers manage security *in* the cloud. Landlord analogy = structure, but tenant shuts the front door.
Clients responsible for customer data, IAM user mgmt, OS network firewall config, encryption in transit and at rest
AWS responsibility if customer cannot access the OS anyway (RDS, lambda, etc.) S3 esp abstracted service only responsible for encryption
SGs are stateful (respective outbound rule created for each inbound rule) 1433 = sql server, 3306 = mysql

AWS Artifact = on demand downloads of AWS security and compliance documents, AWS ISO certs, Payment Card Industry, Service Organization Control reports. Give these documents to regulators as testament to security and compliance of AWS platform.
KMS only uses symmetric crypto, need CloudHSM for assymetric. AWS has control of key for KMS. CloudHSM is FIPS 140-2 & EAL-4 compliant.
S3 can do instant encryption (at rest). Most other services require migration like RDS, EBS, DynamoDB, EFS

IAM:PassRole allows entity to pass roles to AWS services or accounts
IAM "credential report" shows passwords, access keys, registered MFA, etc.
KMS allows you to import own kews, disable/re-enable keys, and define mgmt roles in IAM, but not migrate between any sort of custom key store (can only use default)
Rekognition not usable for authentication and STS
