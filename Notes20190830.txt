Security Token Service
Federation:
    Active Directory, Uses SAML Security Assertion Markup Language
	Allows access to one domain (AWS) based on membership roles in another domain (AD)
Identity Broker:
	Allows you to take identity with one service and federate it with another (Okta)
Identity Store:
	Services like AD, Facebook, Gmail
Scenario:
	1) User enters username and password
	2) Application calls Identity Broker (Okta) and it captures un + pw
	3) Identity broker validates un + pw with existing LDAP directory
	4) Identity broker calls GetFederationToken function using IAM credentials. The call for temp creds must reference existing IAM policy and 1-36 hr duration
	5) STS confirms IAM policy allowed by IAM user gives permission to create new tokens and returns 4 values:
		a) access key
		b) secret access key
		c) token
		d) duration (token life)
	6) Identity broker returns temp creds from STS to original application
	7) Data storage part of original app uses STS creds to make S3 requests
	8) S3 uses IAM to validate STS creds
	9) IAM authorizes s3 to perform requested action
