VPC and Networking
Build a VPC from memory for exam - virtual data center in the cloud and soft limit of 5 per region (aws can increase)
Internet gateway (or Virtual Private Gateway) connects your defined VPC partition of AWS regional infra to internet
then hits router's Route Table within your VPC -> Network ACL -> Public or Private subnets -> Security groups -> Instances
Internal subnets are 10.0.0.0/8 , 172.16.0.0/12 , 192.168.0.0/16 cidr.xyz
All subnets in default VPC have a route out to internet, unlike custom VPC
Since all subnets public, instances launched in them have both public and private IP
VPC peering is direct, not transitive. SGs stateful, NACLs stateless

Creating a new VPC also creates default SG <- NACL <- route table.
It will NOT create subnets, internet gateway, 
AWS subnets reserve first 4 IP addresses and last IP address in each CIDR block. 
e.g. 10.0.0.0/24 reserves:
10.0.0.0 = network address
10.0.0.1 = VPC router address
10.0.0.2 = DNS server address (network_base+=2 always)
10.0.0.3 = reserved for AWS future use
10.0.0.255 = broadcast address (AWS restricted)

Can only attach internet gateway (igw) to 1 VPC at a time.
NAT instances obsolete but on exam. Must disable source/destination checks bc nat instances send traffic where they are not source or destination.
NAT gateways take 10 mins or so to provision and also need route added in route table for 0.0.0.0/0 destination and NAT as target
Egress Only Internet Gateways are ipv6 equivalent of NAT gateways
NAT gateway launched in public subnet with 0.0.0.0/0 route and NAT Gateway as target in route table associated with private subnets. 
NAT gateways patched (and SGs w/ pub ip), scale up to 10 Gbps unlike instances bottle neck based on size (without scripting and other services)

Each subnet can have 1 ACL. ACL:subnets = 1:many. Subnet uses newest NACL association, and reverts to #2 if that one removed.
Default VPC comes with NACLs open for traffic. Custom created VPC have default NACLs that default to deny everything though.
Start NACL inbound rules in increments of 100 for types of traffic. Can refine/adjust 100 times between then.
Block IPs with NACL before it reaches SGs (within subnet). Route table = road and NACL = gate. 

VPC endpoints are like a NAT gateway for another service like RDS, or more commonly an ENI as a secure interface entry point for that service.
VPC Flow Logs provides IP traffic information going to/from network interfaces in a VPC. Forwards to CloudWatch.
3 possible flow log levels: VPC, subnet, or network interface
VPC dash -> Actions -> Create Flow Log. All, Accepted, or Denied traffic only. IAM Flow Logs role, CW log group. 
Cannot enable flow logs for peered VPCs unless in same AWS account.
Does NOT monitor traffic to: AWS DNS servers, 169.254.169.254, DHCP or reserved IPs, Windows license activation
CIDR math, /24 = netmask 255.255.255.0, first IP, last IP, /24 = 256-5 = 251, /25 = 128-5 = 123. max = /16, min = /28.

AWS Direct Connect connection from customer network to AWS private virtual interface in AWS region.
Direct Connect Gateway would route traffic from customer network -> direct connection in US-East1 -> Direct Connect Gateway -> US-West1 services
