VPC and Networking
Build a VPC from memory for exam - virtual data center in the cloud and soft limit of 5 per region (aws can increase)
Internet gateway (or Virtual Private Gateway) connects your defined VPC partition of AWS regional infra to internet
then hits router's Route Table within your VPC -> Network ACL -> Public or Private subnets -> Security groups -> Instances
Internal subnets are 10.0.0.0/8 , 172.16.0.0/12 , 192.168.0.0/16 cidr.xyz
All subnets in default VPC have a route out to internet, unlike custom VPC
Since all subnets public, instances launched in them have both public and private IP
VPC peering is direct, not transitive. SGs stateful, NACLs stateless
